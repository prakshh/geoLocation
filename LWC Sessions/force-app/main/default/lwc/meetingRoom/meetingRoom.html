<!-- 
components and life-cycle 

slots
- placeholder to accept additional markup from parent component

2 types of slots
- named and unnamed (min: 0, max: 1)

use slot as an ATTRIBUTE in parent component to pass/supply markup inside a named slot -- in parent component (meetingRooms.html)
use slot as a TAG in child component to accept markup from parent component -- in child component (meetingRoom.html)

If you have more than 1 unnamed slot,
the markup passed into the body of the component is inserted into all the unnamed slots.

slots - use them to pass additional markup
public properties - use to pass additional data to child and run some logic
